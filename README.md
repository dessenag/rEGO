The rEGO is a refined version of the well-known EGO and allows for a better use of computational power for single-objective problems.
The rEGO workflow is a novelty and the code is built over two existing platforms which are forked under Utilities:

- DACE Toolbox, Hans Bruun Nielsen, Søren Nymand and Lophaven Jacob Søndergaard - https://github.com/psbiomech/dace-toolbox-source
- Single_objective_EGO_algorithms, Qi Zhang - https://github.com/109902249/Single_objective_EGO_algorithms

## Table of Contents
